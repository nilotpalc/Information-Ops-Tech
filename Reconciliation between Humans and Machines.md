<p>It might be strange to discuss this topic in the Era of Industry 4.0, which predicts that the more automated work better is the impact on supply chains’ performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, the question which raise is, could we extract the maximum<br>
benefits from both machines and humans in the supply chain? This is<br>
what supply chain 5.0 aims to answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Pillars of Industry 4.0</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Internet of Things,  Cloud Computing,</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics</li>
<li>Additive Manufacturing, Robotics, Blockchain</li>
<li>Augmented Reality</li>
</ol>
<p>All those technologies effectively integrated allows better performance on supply chain processes in terms of <code>efficiency, integration, collaboration, responsiveness, flexibility, quality and transparency</code>.</p>
<p>The main principles of Industry 5.0 will be as follows -<br>
<strong>Collaborative work between Humans and Robot (Cobot)</strong><br>
Humans and robots will collaboratively work together. The role of robots will be more focused on the roles, which is harder, boring and, dangerous to be executed by humans. Bring Artificial Intelligence aligned with Internet of Things and Big Data Analytics technologies, to be imbedded on the human’s life and extracting all potentialities from them.</p>
<p><strong>Mass Customization and Personalization to Customers:</strong><br>
The perfect harmony between Humans and Machines predicts to allow a more flexibility in terms of personalization of products demanded by customers. The intensive use of disruptive technologies aligned with the creative and smarter job from workers is going to provide higher capacity in delivering personalized products. <em>Mass customization in production systems</em></p>
<p><strong>Super Smart Society (Society 5.0):</strong><br>
Focus more on solving problems regarding people’s quality life and humanity collaborating to create smarter society.<br>
<em>More of a vision</em></p>
